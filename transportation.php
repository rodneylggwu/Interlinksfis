                <p>Transportation and Logistics Services, a part of Facilities Planning, Construction, and Management (FPCM), under the Division of Safety and Facilities, is responsible for managing the day-to-day transportation operations at the George Washington University. We are dedicated to providing the safest, most reliable, and on-time services for the Foggy Bottom, the Mount Vernon, and the Virginia Science and Technology campuses, the GW community, and our visitors while keeping in line with the university’s mission and goals.</p>
                <h4>Public Transportation: </h4>
                <p>The Foggy Bottom campus is served by a myriad of public transit options, including the Foggy Bottom-GWU Metrorail Station (Blue, Silver and Orange Lines), numerous Metrobus routes, & commuter buses from Maryland & Virginia. Metro, Metrobus, & the Circulator are all accessible via a SmarTrip card.</p>
                <p>SmarTrip (metro) cards can be purchased at metro rail stations & online from WMATA.</p>
                <h4>UPass Program:</h4>
                <p>The George Washington University has joined the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s (WMATA) U•Pass program providing full-time students with unlimited use of Metrorail and Metrobus for a discounted, flat fee.</p>
                <p>How it Works: Metro charges GW $1 per day during the semester per enrolled student. Students pay a subsidized fee of $100 on their eBill and the university covers the rest of the cost of the U•Pass transportation program.</p>
                <p>Undergraduate students enrolled in on-campus classes (eg: not study abroad or traditional online only programs) within the Columbian College of Arts & Sciences, Elliott School of International Affairs, GW’s Business School, Milken Institute School of Public Health and School of Engineering & Applied Science are included in this mandatory U•Pass public transit program. Eligible undergraduate students will automatically be assessed the subsidized mandatory student fee on their eBill each fall and spring enrolled.</p>
                <p>The following full-time students must pre-pay a $100 non-refundable student transportation fee via their student account prior to picking up a U•Pass card:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Undergraduate students in the School of Nursing, College of Professional Studies and School of Medicine & Health Sciences enrolled in 12 or more credits/semester.</li>
                    <li>Graduate, medical, doctoral and exchange students enrolled in 9 credits or more/semester.</li>
                    <li>Law students in the JD and LLM programs enrolled in 9 credits or more/semester.</li>
                </ul>
